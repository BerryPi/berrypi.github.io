# Magical Mirai Programming Contest 2023
The aim of [this contest](https://magicalmirai.com/2023/procon/index_en.html) was to make an application with the [TextAlive API](https://developer.textalive.jp/events/magicalmirai2023/) to display a song's lyrics in time with the music.

This was my first time using [TextAlive](textalive), and implementing most of it with [CSS Animations](css_animation) meant I had to solve some new problems with those.
